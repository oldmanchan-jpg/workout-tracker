# Handover — 2026-01-16 (Workout Tracker)

## Current goal
Bring UI up to "HealthPulse-level polish", starting with BottomNav (icons, layout, color scheme, app-like behavior). Avoid band-aids and repo ambiguity.

## What is confirmed true (facts)
- `main` was flattened to match `origin/fix/dashboard-white-blocks` using `reset --hard` + `push --force-with-lease`. Build succeeded.
- BottomNav duplication was removed. Only ONE BottomNav component file should exist:
  - `src/components/BottomNav.tsx` (kept)
  - `src/components/ui/BottomNav.tsx` (deleted)
- Verified by command:
  `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File .\src -Filter "*BottomNav*.tsx"`

## What is broken right now
Bottom navigation renders as a vertical, purple/underlined link stack (looks like default browser links), instead of a styled horizontal app tab bar.

## Why this is critical
Purple + underline strongly indicates either:
1) Tailwind classes are not present on the DOM nodes being rendered (wrong component / wrong output), OR
2) Global CSS is overriding link/nav styles (likely with !important), forcing default link styles and possibly layout.

## High-confidence diagnosis plan (do this first)
1) In DevTools, inspect one BottomNav link:
   - Copy the `<a>` element `class=""` attribute.
   - If classes are missing → the wrong component is being rendered or build output isn't the file we think.
   - If classes are present but still purple/underlined → global CSS override is winning.

2) Search CSS for overrides:
   - Look for `a { ... }`, `a:visited`, `text-decoration`, `nav { ... }`, `!important`, `flex-direction`, `display`, `position`.
   - Fix by scoping or removing the override; only use `!` utilities in BottomNav as last resort.

## What we attempted today (and outcomes)
### Wins
- Main branch reset/flatten succeeded; build succeeded post-reset.
- BottomNav duplicates removed; imports normalized; only one BottomNav file remains.

### Fails / blockers
- BottomNav styling changes did not reflect correctly in the browser; nav appears as default link stack.
- Prior prompts allowed "build passes" to be treated as success even when UI output was not validated via DOM/class inspection.

## Immediate next actions (Claude)
1) Inspect DOM classlist on BottomNav `<a>` elements.
2) Identify if CSS overrides exist (`index.css` / `theme.css` / globals).
3) Fix the override or scope it away from BottomNav.
4) Re-apply modern BottomNav design once the CSS pipeline is confirmed.

## Guardrails going forward
- "Build passes" is necessary, not sufficient.
- Always validate UI changes by inspecting DOM classlist + computed styles.
- One file at a time, one objective at a time. No merges, no duplicate components.
