# Acceptance (Must Pass)
## Commands
- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm run build

## Manual UI Checks (after dev server starts)
- App loads without red screen / runtime exception
- Navigate through core pages (list your routes once known)
- Theme: dark baseline + correct green accent (#29e33c) where applicable
- No console spam (ignore benign warnings only if confirmed)
