# Source of Truth (UI Stabilization Day)
## Single Goal
By end of day: the web app runs with the intended polished UI and no runtime/build errors.

## Non-Goals (Today)
- No new features
- No refactors unless required to fix UI build/runtime
- No design changes beyond restoring the intended green-accent HealthPulse-style theme

## Roles
- Cursor (Composer 1): edits code only when instructed by TASK_CARD allowed files.
- Claude Code: runs commands, reproduces errors, validates fixes.
- PM (ChatGPT): writes TASK_CARD + acceptance criteria + keeps scope locked.
