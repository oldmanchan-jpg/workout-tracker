**Session Start:** TBD  
**Session End:** TBD  
**Duration:** TBD

## Update — 2026-01-18

## ✅ Completed Today
- EMOM + Circuit workout support added (type-based templates + `ActiveWorkout` branching).
- Excel Day 2 (EMOM) + Day 4 (Circuit) now converted via `convert_workout_excel_to_json.py`.
- Supabase schema created: `templates` + `template_assignments` with RLS policies (coach/admin elevated; clients see assigned only).
- Admin import now writes templates to Supabase.
- `ActiveWorkout` loads templates from Supabase (RLS-filtered) with loading/empty states.

## 🚧 Current Caveats / UX Debt (P1)
- Conditioning UX is functional but not “usable polish” yet:
  - EMOM needs clearer visual separation for Minute A vs Minute B.
  - Circuit needs station-level flow (next station), station timer, and structured rest (between stations + between rounds).
  - Current “single pause” / “clamped layout” makes circuits harder to follow.

## 🔜 Next Priority Options
- **P0**: Verify assignment flow end-to-end with 2 clients and empty state for unassigned.
- **P1**: Conditioning runner UX overhaul (station/interval model + UI separation).
- **P1**: Decide final source of truth (localStorage fallback rules for coach).
- **P2**: Add small “debug panel” in Admin showing template counts in Supabase vs local.

## Archive — 2026-01-16 session log

## ✅ Completed Tasks (2026-01-16)

### Part 1: Initial Implementation (12:10 PM - 12:42 PM)

### 1. Requirements Gathering ✅
- Reviewed previous conversation about UI design options
- Confirmed Option C (Compact List View) as chosen design
- Confirmed feature set:
  - Number input for RPE
  - Manual rest timer
  - Auto-complete sets
  - Manual exercise navigation

### 2. Code Implementation ✅
**File: `src/pages/ActiveWorkout.tsx`**
- Complete rewrite with compact list view design
- Implemented per-set state tracking system
- Added RPE input field (1-10 scale with validation)
- Built individual rest timers per set with:
  - Play/Pause/Reset controls
  - Color-coded display (red ≤10s, green when done)
  - Customizable duration
  - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Auto-complete feature to copy last set values
- Add extra set functionality
- Fixed bottom navigation bar
- Status indicators for each set (pending/in-progress/completed)

**File: `src/types.ts`**
- Added `rpe?: number` field to `ExerciseSet` type

**File: `src/services/workoutService.ts`**
- Added `rpe?: number` field to `WorkoutData` interface

**File: `README.md`**
- Added comprehensive feature descriptions
- Documented new workout logging features
- Added Supabase setup instructions
- Explained mobile-first design philosophy

### 3. Testing ✅
- Verified no linter errors
- Confirmed TypeScript compilation successful

### 4. Version Control ✅
- Staged all modified files
- Created descriptive commit message
- Committed changes (hash: `843c246`)

  - `TODAY_SESSION_PLAN.md`

### Part 2: UX Refinements (12:45 PM - 1:15 PM)

### 6. User Feedback & Bug Fixes ✅
**Issues Reported:**
- Input fields were empty, requiring manual entry every time
- Rest timer auto-started, removing user control

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Pre-filled all input fields with template values (reps, weight, RPE default 7)
- Changed rest timer to manual start only (user clicks Play button)
- Values persist between sets for quick one-click logging
- Template values auto-fill when switching exercises

### 7. Code Refinement ✅
- Updated initial state for `currentReps`, `currentWeight`, `currentRPE`
- Modified `handleCompleteSet` to keep values instead of clearing
- Updated `handleNextExercise` and `handlePreviousExercise` to pre-fill with template values
- Changed `restTimerActive` from `true` to `false` for manual control

### 8. Testing & Validation ✅
- Verified no linter errors
- Confirmed TypeScript compilation successful
- Verified logical flow of pre-filled values

### 9. Documentation Update ✅
- Updated `2_COMPLETED_WORK.md` with Part 2 session
- Updated `TODAY_SESSION_PLAN.md` with refinement details
- Committed and pushed changes (commit: `a243490`)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **State Management:**
   - Used `SetState[]` array to track each set independently
   - Separated timer state per set for granular control
   
2. **Timer Implementation:**
   - Used `useRef<Map<number, number>>` to manage multiple timer intervals
   - Proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks
   
3. **Auto-complete Strategy:**
   - Pre-fills form after completing a set (not clearing inputs)
   - Allows quick adjustments while maintaining data

### Performance Considerations
- Timer cleanup on component unmount
- Efficient state updates (only updating specific set states)
- Minimal re-renders with proper dependency arrays

---

## 🚧 Known Issues / Tech Debt
- [ ] Need actual mobile device testing
- [ ] Rest timer completion needs audio/vibration feedback
- [ ] No offline support yet
- [ ] Loading states during workout save missing
- [ ] No confirmation when leaving workout mid-session

---

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### What Went Well ✅
- Clear design mockup made implementation straightforward
- User provided specific feature requirements upfront
- Compact list view significantly improves mobile UX
- Per-set rest timers solve a real user pain point
- Auto-complete will speed up workout logging considerably

### Challenges Faced ⚠️
- Initial miscommunication about which MD files to update
- Had to rewrite entire ActiveWorkout component (not just modify)
- Managing multiple timer intervals required careful state management

### User Feedback Received
- ✅ User wants project MD files always kept current for context sharing
- ✅ User emphasized importance of documentation for AI handoffs
- ⚠️ User frustrated when documentation wasn't updated (valid concern)

---

## 🎯 Next Session Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test on actual iPhone/Android device
   - Verify touch targets are appropriately sized
   - Test rest timer functionality
   - Verify auto-complete works as expected

2. **User Experience Polish**
   - Add sound/vibration for rest timer completion
   - Add haptic feedback on set completion (mobile)
   - Improve loading states during workout save
   - Add confirmation before leaving mid-workout

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fix any issues discovered during mobile testing
   - Edge case testing (what if user adds 10 extra sets?)
   - Test rapid clicking of Complete Set button

### Medium Priority
4. **Template Management**
   - Allow users to create custom templates
   - Edit existing templates
   - Template categorization

5. **Enhanced Progress View**
   - Show RPE trends over time
   - Volume progression charts
   - Personal records tracking

### Low Priority
6. **Settings Page**
   - Default rest timer duration
   - Weight units (kg/lbs)
   - Theme preference

---

## 💭 Questions for Next Session
- Should rest timer auto-start after completing a set? (Currently: yes)
- Should we add sound effects / vibration?
- Do we need a "Skip Set" button for sets user can't complete?
- How should incomplete exercises be handled when finishing workout?
- Should we save workout progress locally in case of crashes?

## 🔄 Handoff Notes for Claude/Next AI Assistant

### Context for Next Session
This session completed the **Compact List View** redesign for workout logging. The app now has a mobile-optimized interface where users can:
- See all sets in a list (no hidden forms)
- Log reps, weight, and RPE inline
- Use per-set rest timers with manual controls
- Auto-complete data from previous sets
- Add extra sets beyond the template

### What Needs Testing
The new UI has NOT been tested on actual mobile devices yet. High priority for next session.

### Important User Preferences
- User wants ALL project MD files updated after every significant change
- These files are used to share context with AI assistants
- Being 30+ minutes behind on documentation causes confusion
- Always update: `1_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `2_COMPLETED_WORK.md`, `3_FUTURE_ROADMAP.md`, `TODAY_SESSION_PLAN.md`

### Technical Context
- Using Supabase (not Firebase) for backend
- Primary focus is mobile (99.9% of users)
- Desktop is for admin/template management only
- All timer management uses `useRef` with cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**End of Session**  
All goals achieved ✅  
Ready for testing and next feature iteration 🚀
